<p>CareOff’s security of collected information</p>



<p>Your CareOff account is password-protected so that only you and authorized CareOff staff have access to your account information. In order to maintain this protection, do not give your password to anyone. If someone who represents to you they are CareOff staff and asks for any personal account information, including password, check their URL. If it doesn’t say they are support@CareOff, they aren’t. Also, if you share a computer, you should sign out of your CareOff account and close the browser window before someone else logs on. This will help protect your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.</p>



<p>CareOff makes every effort to ensure that your information is secure on its system by backing up data in separate backup drives and uses public key access encryption and firewalls on both our main and backup servers. We also employ and customer record managers to protect against loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Extremely sensitive information, like credit card numbers, is always transmitted in encrypted form. Only certain authorized CareOff staff can access Personal Information, and then only if it is relevant to their job duties. CareOff has staff dedicated to maintaining this Privacy Policy and other privacy initiatives, periodically reviewing security and making sure that every CareOff employee is aware of our security practices. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, CareOff cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. While CareOff will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal and/or financial information stored therein, and you agree to hold CareOff harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. If you have any further questions on this issue, please refer to the Terms of Use, available at a href=”https://CareOff.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/215072787-Terms-Conditions-” http://www.CareOff.com/termsCareOff expressly disclaims any liability that may arise should any other individuals obtain the information you submit to this website.</p>



<p>With whom does CareOff share information?</p>



<p>When you submit information to CareOff, it is collected, processed and maintained solely by us or by third party agents who are bound by privacy restrictions at least as restrictive as those set forth in this policy. We may allow our business partners to collect information about Users that is not extremely sensitive Information. If you would like to opt out from the onward transfer of your information to our non-agent partners, you may send us an email at support@careoff.comInclude the word “privacy” in the subject line of the email and all your registration information in the body of the email.</p>



<p>Some CareOff content is “sponsored by” or “presented by” other companies. CareOff shares market research data (how the sponsorship performed, names of contest winners, etc.) collected on this website or via email surveys with these partners. This information is aggregate and not linked to specific users.</p>



<p>Partners may sponsor promotions, contests and sweepstakes that require you to reveal details such as your name, address or phone number. Always check their privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don’t want these sponsors to have your personal information, you can choose to not participate.</p>



<p>CareOff reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of this website at our discretion, if required by law or if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interference with the rights of Users, the general public, or CareOff, to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process.</p>



<p>We will not transfer to a non-Agent third party any Personal Information that is sensitive in nature, such as information specifying your medical or health condition, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership without your prior affirmative consent.</p>



<p>Finally, CareOff reserves the right to transfer, sell and/or distribute all information collected through the Service to an affiliate, subsidiary, or third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or part of our business, assets or stock. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the new entity follows this Privacy Policy with respect to your Personal Information, as and to the extent required by applicable law.</p>



<p>How can Users edit their information?</p>



<p>CareOff believes strongly in giving you the ability to access and edit your personal information. To update your personal info, click My Account. There you can view, update and correct your account information. You may edit your account information at any time all you need is your username and password.</p>



<p>So that we can protect the integrity of sensitive data, there are certain pieces of information, such as your age, that you cannot alter yourself. For example, since children under 18 are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users’ ages.

<p>2. CareOff is a Venue.</p>



<p>Our Properties provide an online venue that connect users who are independent third-party providers of medical services (e.g. nurses and medical technicians) and are willing to fill short-term staffing positions (“<strong>Professionals</strong>”) with users who are independent third-parties that seek to contract with such Professionals for short-term staffing positions (“<strong>Medical Facilities</strong>” or “<strong>Facilities</strong>”). Each Medical Facility’s request for Professional Services that is submitted on Our Properties is hereinafter referred to as a “<strong>Request</strong>.” For each Request, the Professional who accepted the Request shall perform, for the duration of the short-term staffing position, the medical services that the Medical Facility entered in its Request (“<strong>Professional Services</strong>”). Collectively, Professionals and Medical Facilities are our “<strong>Users</strong>.”</p>



<p>2.1 Staffing Requests. Each Request will be for one Professional (i.e. to retain two Professionals, two Requests must be submitted). Each Request must contain the nature and type of Professional Services required from the Professional (e.g. I need a medical technician for a heart surgery), including, for example, a description of the needed services, the start and end time of the position, the location where the Professional Services must be performed, whether the Request is for an independent contractor or temporary employee, and other information that may be necessary or that we request. Each Request that a Professional has accepted and has fully performed to the satisfaction of the Medical Facility is hereinafter referred to as a “<strong>Completed Request</strong>.” Each Request for Professional Services that occurs on a recurring or regular basis (e.g. every day or certain days every week) is hereinafter referred to as a “<strong>Recurring Request</strong>.”</p>



<p>2.2 Only a Venue. We only offer a method for Medical Facilities and Professionals to communicate and contract with one another, and a medium to exchange money between Professionals and Medical Facilities. You acknowledge and agree that by submitting or accepting a Request, you enter into an agreement directly with another User. You acknowledge and agree that CareOff is not a party to such agreements. We disclaim all liability arising from or related to any such agreements between Medical Facilities and Professionals except as related to our obligation to process payments pursuant to the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CareOff does not:</p>



<ul><li>Provide or Request Professional Services,</li><li>Have or take any responsibility or liability for any Professional Services provided to Medical Facilities by Professionals,</li><li>Take part in the interactions between Users,</li><li>Provide training, equipment, materials, or supervision to Professionals;</li><li>Have control over the manner, means, quality, timing, legality, or failure to provide Professional Services or any aspect whatsoever of any feedback or ratings provided by Users; or</li><li>Have control over the integrity, responsibility, or any actions of any Users.</li></ul>



<p>2.3 Worker Classification. Medical Facilities are responsible for making their own decision regarding Professionals that they engage for Professional Services and should conduct their own investigations prior to engaging any Professionals. Although Professionals must undergo background checks, phone interviews and other verification processes in order to create an Account, we make no representations about and disclaim all liability associated with: (i) the suitability, reliability, and timeliness of the Professional Services provided by Professionals; and (ii) each Professional’s credentials, background, suitability, and reliability. Medical Facilities assume all liability for proper classification of Medical Professionals as independent contractors or employees based on applicable legal guidelines. Medical Facilities further warrant and represent that all classification decisions are proper and made in accordance with applicable law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This Agreement does not create a partnership or agency relationship between the Medical Facility and CareOff. CareOff does not have authority to enter into written or oral –whether implied or express –contracts on behalf of the Medical Facility. CareOff does not, in any way, supervise, direct or control the Professionals’ work or services performed in any manner. CareOff does not set the Professional’s work hours and location of work, nor is CareOff involved in determining the type or manner of compensation to be paid for any Request. CareOff will not provide Professionals with training or any equipment, tools, labor or materials needed for a particular Request. CareOff will not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, Social Security, or other taxes as it would in the case of an employee. Users will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority, in any state, with respect to the Professionals’ performance of the Professional Services. For contracts classified as independent contractor relationships, Medical Facilities may not require an exclusive relationship between the Professional and the Facility. A Professional classified as an independent contractor is free at all times to perform Requests, be employed by otherwise engage with persons or businesses other than the Facility, including any competitor of the Facility. For contracts classified as employer-employee relationships, Facilities will manage the Request through CareOff’s payrolling program, where the Professional becomes an hourly employee of CareOff’s staffing affiliate the Facility and the Professional enter into appropriate additional agreements. Users agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend CareOff from any and all claims arising out of or related to their Request, including but not limited to claims that a Professional was misclassified as an independent contractor, any liabilities arising from a determination by a court, arbitrator, government agency or other body that a Professional was misclassified (including, but not limited to taxes, penalties, interest and attorney’s fees), any claim that CareOff was an employer or joint employer of a Professional, as well as claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation, as well as any claims for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker’s compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits. Any disputes related to the Professional Services must be resolved directly between Professionals and Medical Facilities.</p>

<p>6. Fees and Payments.</p>



<p>6.1 Types of Fees. Upon completion of a Request, the Medical Facility that made the Request will be charged: (1) a fee for the Professional’s performance of the Professional Services (“<strong>Professional Fee</strong>”); and (2) a fee for use of our Services (“<strong>CareOff Fee</strong>”). Collectively, the Professional Fee and CareOff Fee are the “<strong>Fees</strong>.” Each Medical Facility must pay the Fees as described in Section 7.1 (Medical Facility Payment Terms). All Fees are in US dollars unless otherwise specified herein or on the Services.</p>



<p>6.2 Amount of Fees. The Medical Facility that submitted the Request will be charged the amount of Fees listed on Our Properties (or if not listed on Our Properties, the amount communicated to the Medical Facility by CareOff prior to submission of the Request). For a full list of our Fees please visit our “Fee Policy” page within your Account. Unless otherwise negotiated, CareOff calculates these Fees at the default pricing rates based on the local market rate for the type of service that the Professional is engaged to perform and based on input from the Professionals. After a Professional accepts a job, the pricing rate for that job cannot be adjusted. The Fees charged for each Request varies as follows:</p>



<ul><li><em>CareOff Fee. </em>The CareOff Fee varies depending on the geographic location the Professional Services are to be performed and Professional Services described in the Request.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Professional Fee</em>. The Professional Fee for engaging a Professional as an independent contractor varies depending on the length of the engagement, the geographic location where the Professional Services are performed, and other factors, such as the Professional’s experience and other negotiated terms. If a Professional, as an independent contractor, works over eight consecutive hours, the Medical Facility shall pay a greater hourly rate to that Professional (the “<strong>Surge Rate</strong>”) as follows: (i) if the Professional works over eight (8) but less than twelve (12) consecutive hours, the Surge Rate shall be one and a half (1.5) times the hourly rate of that Professional for each consecutive hour the Professional works beyond eight (8) hours and less than twelve (12) hours; and (ii) if the Professional works over twelve (12) consecutive hours, the Surge Rate shall be two (2) times the hourly rate of that Professional for each consecutive hour the Professional works beyond twelve (12) hours. The Professional Fee for engaging a Professional as an employee will be determined based on the type of engagement and geographic location of the Professional.</li></ul>



<p>6.3 Fees Subject to Change. You agree that we, in our sole discretion, may modify and increase the Fees at any time and for any reason. If we modify the Fees, the modified Fees will not apply to Requests that were submitted prior to the modification.</p>



<p>6.4 Our Payment Processor<em>.</em>We use Stripe Inc. (“<strong>Stripe</strong>”) as a third party service provider for payment services for independent contractor engagements, including to process Fees. For employee engagements, CareOff will process the payment through a third party vendor who will issue the payment as a paycheck. Stripe will store any Payment Provider Account information entered on Our Properties and will charge such Payment Provider Accounts as outlined herein. By paying or receiving funds through Our Properties, you agree to be bound by the Stripe US Services Agreement available at: https://stripe.com/us/legal. If applicable, Stripe will report amounts paid to Professionals by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Services, as required by law. For more information about the way we use and share your personal information with our third-party payment processor, please visit our Privacy Policy available at: [https://www.CareOff.com/privacy-policy].&nbsp;</p>



<p>6.5 Refunds<em>.</em>CareOff has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them in extenuating circumstances in our sole discretion, for instance, to correct any errors we made. We do our best to correct errors we make and that we become aware of. If you believe CareOff made an error in processing your payment(s), please contact us at the contact information listed in Section 1 (Questions &amp; Concerns).&nbsp;</p>



<p>6.6 No Circumvention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A. Payments For Requests Through CareOff. Our value rests in our thriving venue of Professionals and Medical Facilities. CareOff receives payment when a Facility and a Professional pay and receive payment through the CareOff platform. For 24 months from the time a User identifies or is identified by any party through the platform (“<strong>Non-Circumvention Period</strong>”), unless you pay the Opt-Out Fee in Section 6.6(B), you agree to use the platform as the exclusive method to request, make and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that party or arising out of your relationship with that party (“<strong>CareOff Relationship</strong>”). It is a violation of the Agreement during the Non-Circumvention Period (a) for a Medical Facility to knowingly offer a payment of Fees outside of the context of Our Properties for a Request found on our platform; or (b) for a Professional to knowingly accept a Request with the intention of delegating the performance of the Professional Services to another health-care professional. YOU SHALL IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY US IF ANOTHER USER REQUESTS THAT PAYMENT BE MADE THROUGH CHANNELS OTHER THAN THOSE PROVIED OR SPECIFIED BY CAREOFF.</p>



<p>B. Except if you pay the Opt-Out Fee (see Section 6.5 C), you agree not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered by the Site. By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to:</p>



<p>a. Solicit parties identified through the Site to contract, hire, per-diem, work with, or pay outside the Site.</p>



<p>b. Solicit parties identified through the Site to contract, invoice, or receive payment outside the Site.</p>



<p>c. Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments off the Site.</p>



<p>C. Opting Out. Users may opt-out of the obligation in Section 6.6(A) with respect to each CareOff Relationship if the User pays CareOff an opt-out fee for each such relationship (“<strong>Opt-Out Fee</strong>”). The Opt-Out Fee is computed as follows The Opt-Out Fee is computed as follows 18% of the anticipated annualized salary or wages for one year if the healthcare facility offers the Professional permanent employment or per-diem. CareOff, in its sole discretion, may determine whether a User violated Section 6.6. In the event a violation is identified, CareOff or its affiliates may (1) charge your Payment Provider the Opt-Out Fee (including interest), to the extent permitted by law, or may send you an invoice for the Opt-Out Fee (including interest), which the User shall pay within 30 days; (2) terminate your account and revoke your authorization to use the platform; and/or (3) charge you for all losses, costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees) related to investigating such breach and the collection of such fees.</p>



<p>To pay the Opt-Out Fee, you must request instructions by sending an email message to support@CareOff.com</p>

<p>7.3 Professional Payment Terms.</p>



<ul><li><em>Payment of Fees.</em>We will inform you of the varying amounts of Fees when we interview you as described in Section 5.1.B (To Register as a Professional). If you perform a service under an employee engagement, your fees will be issued to you from a third-party payroll provider as a paycheck. If you perform a service under an independent contractor engagement, the Professional Fees owed to you will be deposited in your bank account as described in Section 7.3.B (Bank Account Information) within forty-eight (48) hours of the Request being marked as a Completed Request on Our Properties. For clarity, if you perform a Recurring Request, the amount owed to you for each day your performance will be deposited within forty-eight (48) hours from the time that a Medical Facility marks your performance for that day as a Completed Request on Our Properties.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Bank Account Information. </em>You agree to enter your current bank account information within your Account, and agree that our third-party payment processors and we may transfer the Professional Fees you are owed, if any, upon your completion of a Request that you accepted to such bank account. You, and not us, are solely responsible for the accuracy of your bank account information, including your bank account number and routing information. We disclaim all liability related to errors in fund deposits due to inaccurate or incomplete bank account information.</li><li><em>Disclaimer. </em>IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT THE PROFESSIONAL FEES THAT ARE OWED TO YOU, WE WILL INFORM YOU IN WRITING. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO IMPOSE COLLECTION PROCEDURES ON MEDICAL FACILITIES AND DO NOT GUARANTEE PAYMENT FROM MEDICAL FACILITIES.</li><li><em>Taxes</em>. You are solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any U.S. federal, state, or local tax authority with respect to your performance of Professional Services and receipt of Professional Fees under this TOS Agreement. You agree to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws, including laws governing self-employed individuals, if applicable, such as laws related to payment of taxes, social security, disability, and other contributions based on Professional Fees paid to you by Medical Facilities under this TOS Agreement. CareOff will not withhold or make payments for taxes, social security, unemployment insurance or disability insurance contributions, or obtain workers’ compensation insurance on your behalf. You hereby agree to indemnify and defend CareOff against any and all such taxes or contributions, including penalties and interest. We cannot and do not offer tax advice to our Users.</li></ul>

If you are a User outside the United States, any references to Services in your country does not imply any intention to announce such Services in your country.

<p>16. No Third Party Beneficiaries</p>



<p>You acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Agreement with the exception of the Arbitration provisions set forth in Section 17 below, there shall be no third party beneficiaries in to the Agreement.</p>



<p>17. ARBITRATION</p>



<p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section 17 (<strong>“ArbitrationAgreement”</strong>) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate disputes with CareOff and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>17.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement<em>. </em>You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of our Website, to any Services distributed through our Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with CareOff, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or CareOff may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).&nbsp;</p>



<p>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH CAREOFF, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST CAREOFF ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF, UNLESS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY LAW. INSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING YOUR CLAIMS AGAINST CAREOFF IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW BY AN ARBITRATOR. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>



<p>17.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum<em>. </em>The Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.) governs this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent. JMAS The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider, or another alternative resolution provider based on the written agreement of the parties. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.comor by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees of JAMS, or another alternative dispute resolution provider and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, CareOff will pay them for you. In addition, CareOff will reimburse all such filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, CareOff will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous and CareOff would otherwise be entitled to an award of such fees and costs had the matter been heard in court. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>17.3 Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and CareOff. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties unless all parties (including CareOff) consent in writing. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, and the TOS Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis to the same extent that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>17.4 Waiver of Bench or Jury Trial. YOU AND CAREOFF HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and CareOff are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Arbitration Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.&nbsp;</p>



<p>17.5 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.&nbsp;</p>



<p>17.6 Severability<em>. </em>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>



<p>17.7 Survival of Arbitration Agreement<em>. </em>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with CareOff.</p>



<p>17.8 Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if CareOff makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not apply to any individual claim(s) for which you have demanded arbitration or then pending in arbitration.</p>



<p>18. Massachusetts Users &amp; Residents</p>

<p>19.General Provisions.</p>

If the last email address you provided to us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required or permitted by the Agreement, our dispatch of the email containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.

<p>19.2 Assignment.

<p>19.3 Force Majeure. Any delay or failure to perform by us or you (except the payment of money owed) will not be considered a breach of this Agreement if such delay or failure to perform is caused by causes outside our reasonable control, including Internet service interruptions, or governmental demands or requirements.</p>



<p>19.4 Exclusive Venue. To the extent the parties are permitted under the TOS Agreement to initiate litigation in a court, both you and CareOff agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Massachusetts.</p>



<p>19.5 Governing Law. The Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of Massachusetts, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Agreement.</p>



<p>19.6 Export Control. You may not use, export, import, or transfer Our Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained Our Properties, and any other applicable laws. In particular, but without limitation, Our Properties may not be exported or re-exported: (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List. By using Our Properties, you represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a country that supports terrorists, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use Our Properties for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. You acknowledge and agree that our Services and/or technology are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States. You shall comply with these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior U.S. government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer our Services or technology, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation of such laws and regulations.</p>



<p>19.7 Entire Agreement. The Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the parties with respect to such subject matter. Subject to any limitations set forth in Section 17 for Arbitration, this Agreement may be amended or superseded only be a mutually-executed writing. As used herein, “<strong>including</strong>” means “including without limitation”. The headings used in the Agreement are included only for purposes of convenience and shall not limit or otherwise affect the construction of the Agreement.</p>



<p>19.8 Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>



<p>19.9 Severability. If any portion of the Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of you and us, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
